LoopPay Architecture

Core Components:
1. PaymentLoop.sol - Main contract managing recurring payments
2. PaymentInvoiceNFT.sol - ERC721 contract for payment receipts
3. PaymentLoopFactory.sol - Factory for deploying new instances

Design Patterns:
- UUPS Proxy for upgradeability
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- ReentrancyGuard for security

Data Flow:
1. Owner creates loop with recipient + amount + interval
2. Executor calls executeLoop when nextExecution <= block.timestamp
3. USDC transferred from owner to recipient
4. NFT invoice minted to recipient
5. nextExecution updated for next cycle
